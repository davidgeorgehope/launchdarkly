# launchdarkly

To run this you need at least Java 18

1 - Login to launchdarkly and set up the feature flags 'backend-note' and 'edit-note'.Â 

2 - Clone this repository and then switch to the 'target' directory

3 - Run the application by typing 'java -jar launchdarkly-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war'

4 - Go to http://localhost:8080/login

5 - Enter a username, client key and sdk key.

6 - Go to launch darkly and test turning on/off the flags for specific users. 

Provided everything is working correctly you should see that the Edit Button will enable/disable depending on the 'edit-note' flag and that the text below the table will change depending on the 'backend-note' flag.

Questions for LD discussion, 

-Do you ever find that people end up creating thousands of usernames by accident or because of hacking?

-What do you do about if/else sprawl is there a better way to wrap features that just with if statements?

NOTE: I understand using the singleton to store credentials would be very bad in priciple. I would use a cookie/session/local storage and/or database for this data in a production scenario
